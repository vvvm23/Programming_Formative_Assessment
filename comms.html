			<h1 id="s1">Communication at Lightning Speeds</h1>
			<p>Long distance communication has existed for centuries in the form of smoke signals and beacons. It is only recently that we have developed ways of transmitting information across the world in an instant. Since the 20th century, we have been using wires and radio signals to transmit messages. These wires are the basis of the internet that we all take for granted today.</p>
			<p>An early form of internet access known as dial-up allowed users to connect to the internet using the copper cables that made up the telephone network. Digital signals from a computer were converted to analogue signals using a modem. The typical maximum speed of dial-up connections is very slow, around 56 kbit/s. More modern internet access employs the use of fibre-optic cables to transmit information. There are also ways to access the internet without cables, such as Wi-Fi and the broadband cellular network (3G, 4G etc).</p>
			<h1 id="s2">Mobile Phones</h1>
			<p>Years ago, phones looked more like this than this. The majority of the developed world now walk around with a mobile phone in their pocket on a daily basis. Mobile phones developed over the years from being brick-sized devices with only calling capability. More and more features were added including cameras and touch-screens, and the first phone with games was released in 1994 (the Hagenuk MT-2000).</p>
			<h1 id="s3">Email</h1>
			<p>Email (short for Electronic Mail) may be overlooked as a method of day-to-day communication nowadays, but it was state-of-the-art technology back in the 1960s. Early systems required both the sender and recipient to be online in order to send a message. Wikipedia lists 11 issues with the transmission of email such as spam, attachment size limitation and malware.</p>
			<h1 id="s4">Social Media</h1>
			<p>Many people use Snapchat, Facebook and Twitter on a daily basis but they are fairly recent developments in terms of technology. Facebook itself was only launched in 2004, and the company has been a tech monolith, acquiring other businesses such as Instagram, Whatsapp and a myriad of startups. </p>
