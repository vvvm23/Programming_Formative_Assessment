			<h1 id="s1">Diagnosis</h1>
			<p>Scanning technology is one notable example of the use of technology in medicine through technologies such as CT and MRI scans and improvements on the quality of scans such as X-rays. These technolgies greatly increase the probabilty of a correct diagnosis and allow for symptons to be discovered sooner and so dealt with sooner.</p>
			<p>In the near future, we can also expect the use of machine learning in diagnosis to become more prominent. Machine Learning can automatically and accurately deduce whether a patient has a given disease from the results of scans before any human doctor can.</p>
			<h1 id="s2">Drug Testing</h1>
			<p>Computer models can be used to simulate the effects of drugs on the human body and so can be used to test for any negative side effects of medical drugs. As of writing, the timeline from the discovery of a new drug to the drug being released to the public is, at minimum, 10 years. The use of these simulations should greatly reduce this timeline, allowing the creation of new and safe drugs to be completed quicker.</p>
			<h1 id="s3">Remote Monitoring</h1>
			<p>The advent of the internet allows for patients to be remotely monitored by doctors on their condition. This allows for patients with long term conditions or less severe conditions to continue life as normal as possible by reducing the number of trips needed to the doctors. It can also be used to alert emergency services if the patient's condition becomes more critical. One example is in modern pacemakers which have a heart beat sensor built into them that can alert emergency services if the heart rate falls outside the acceptable range.</p>
			<h1 id="s4">Human Genome Sequencing</h1>
			<p>The entire Human Genome could not have been sequenced without the use of computers due to the sheer size and complexity of the human genome. Large amounts of storage and processing power were required which simply could not have been achieved by humans alone in a similar timeframe. Mapping the entire Human Genome is one of the biggest breakthroughs in Genetics in many decades.</p>
			<p>This has many benefits for medicine and could change how medicine is practised. It would allow medicine to become predictive rather than reactive. For example, it could allow for people with a high probabilty of cancer to be screened and tested many years before tumours become an issue.</p>
