				<h1 id="s1">Introduction</h1>
				<p>Science has always been at the heart of computing. Computers have allowed science to reach new heights by vastly enhancing the power humans have to perform complex calculations at great speed. We can
				now simulate systems such as the human body, stars or ecosystems in a way that was unthinkable as little as 30 years ago, leading to exciting new discoveries.</p>

				<h1 id="s2">Origins</h1>
				<p>The idea of computing goes back to devices such as the abacus as a tool to aid with calculation. However, the first electronic computers appeared in World War 2. Colossus was the world's first electronic
				programmable computer, designed by Tommy Flowers in Bletchley Park near Buckingham, England, to break German coded messages. After this the development of computers took off. They went from being
				gigantic machines filling entire rooms, to single boards of transistors and chips to devices we can hold in the palm of your hand, thousands or even millions of times more powerful than those from even just
				a few years ago.</p>

				<h1 id="s3">Maths and Computers</h1>
				<p>At the heart of scientific computing is maths. This is what computers are built to do billions of times faster than any human. One area that computers can be of
				use is in proofs. The first ever computer assisted proof was the 4 colour theorem in 1976. This states that any map can be couloured in such a way that no two bordering
				regions are the same colour using 4 colours at most. Some mathematicians are unhappy with computer-aided proofs, as they feel it undermines the process of discovering
				new techniques by using the brute force and speed of computers to check solutions, whereas others say that it will enable the foundation of new mathematics that no
				human could manage to calculate on their own.</p>
